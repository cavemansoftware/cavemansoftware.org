    <h2>3. Similar Devices &amp; How to Differentiate</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Simile vs. Metaphor</h3>
      <p class="similarity"><strong>Similarity:</strong> Both compare two unlike things to create meaning.</p>
      <p class="difference"><strong>Difference:</strong> Similes use "like" or "as" (<b>"as brave as a lion"</b>), while metaphors say something <em>is</em> something else (<b>"He is a lion in battle."</b>).</p>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you see "like" or "as," it’s a simile. No "like" or "as"? Metaphor.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Allusion vs. Symbolism</h3>
      <p class="similarity"><strong>Similarity:</strong> Both refer to something beyond the literal text.</p>
      <p class="difference"><strong>Difference:</strong> An allusion is a brief, indirect reference (often cultural or literary), while symbolism is a broader use of objects or ideas to represent themes or concepts.</p>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Allusions usually name or hint at something specific outside the text (e.g., a famous person), symbolism is embedded meaning in objects within the text.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Irony vs. Sarcasm</h3>
      <p class="similarity"><strong>Similarity:</strong> Both involve saying one thing but meaning another.</p>
      <p class="difference"><strong>Difference:</strong> Irony is a broad literary device involving contrast (situational, verbal, dramatic), while sarcasm is a sharp, often mocking verbal irony aimed to hurt or ridicule.</p>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> If it’s mean or mocking speech, it’s probably sarcasm. If it’s situational or dramatic contrast, it’s irony.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Anaphora vs. Repetition</h3>
      <p class="similarity"><strong>Similarity:</strong> Both involve repeating words or phrases for effect.</p>
      <p class="difference"><strong>Difference:</strong> Anaphora is repetition specifically at the beginning of successive sentences or clauses; general repetition can be anywhere in the sentence.</p>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Check if the repeated phrase is at the start of lines—if yes, anaphora.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Hyperbole vs. Overstatement</h3>
      <p class="similarity"><strong>Similarity:</strong> Both exaggerate reality for effect.</p>
      <p class="difference"><strong>Difference:</strong> Hyperbole is an obvious, often humorous exaggeration; overstatement may be less obvious and sometimes accidental.</p>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> If the exaggeration is extreme and clearly not meant to be literal, it’s hyperbole.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Oxymoron vs. Paradox</h3>
      <p class="similarity"><strong>Similarity:</strong> Both involve contradictions.</p>
      <p class="difference"><strong>Difference:</strong> Oxymoron is a brief phrase combining contradictory words (<b>"deafening silence"</b>), paradox is a longer statement that seems contradictory but reveals truth.</p>
      <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Short phrase with contradictions? Oxymoron. Longer, meaningful contradiction? Paradox.</p>
